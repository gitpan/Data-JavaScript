Numbers
      Infinity

      NaN

      const

More robust var naming (get & use perl names?)

Unify:
	Data::JavaScript
	Data::JavaScript::LiteObject
		allow objects to be stuffed into an array and use the key names
		as var names? to what end, would have to know var names

	Data::JavaScript::Anon		(Perl: anonymous :: JS: literal)
		jsdump takes undef as name

		worries too much about valid numbers, but not strings

	Template::Plugin::JavaScript
		__quotemeta

	XML feed, Atom feed?

ECMAScript and charset support for hjsdump; non-ASCII literals
